Hello everyone! I am Yi Zhou, now a last-year master student in the [Vision Computing Lab](https://scuvis.org/) at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Min Zhu](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1279/13673.htm). I received bachelor degree from Sichuan University in 2021, under the [Wu Yuzhang honors program](https://www.scu.edu.cn/wyzxy/). Check my [CV](https://echochou990919/files/YiZhou-CV.pdf) for more details.

My current background is in bioinformatics and data visualization, devoted to proposing effective and explainable link prediction methods on biomedical interaction graphs. My research interests are **Graph Machine Learning** and **Data Mining**, especially towards knowledge understanding in real-world scenarios: identifying valuable problems, improving learning methods, and ensuring the conducted insights are trustworthy.

I am looking for a Ph.D. position in 24 Fall preferably, and here is a [blog]() introducing my strong self-motivation. It's widely said that "connection is all you need" for the Ph.D. application, and while I don't currently have any connection with the community of Graph. However, let's look at it positively from the perspective of "Link Prediction", what an exciting process of cold start! I would appreciate any opportunity for collaboration.  

# News

- [Jul. 2023] My second work EGPMDA was available online. I discussed the generalizability and explainability of miRNA-disease association prediction.
- [Jun. 2023] GBDT4CTRVis was accepted by ChinaVis 2023, congrats to Wenwen! It would be transferred to Journal of Visualization soon.
- [Sep. 2022] My first work LDAformer was accepted by Briefings in Bioinformatics. It's the best publication ever in the bioinformatics group of Vision Computing Lab.
