Hello everyone! I am Yi Zhou, now a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Wenqi Fan](https://wenqifan03.github.io/) and Prof. [Qing Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csqli/). In 2024, I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University, advised by Prof. [Min Zhu](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1279/13673.htm). In 2021, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University, under the [Wu Yuzhang Honors program](https://www.scu.edu.cn/wyzxy/).

<!-- Here is my [CV](https://echochou990919.github.io/files/YiZhou_CV.pdf). -->

<!-- My research background is in bioinformatics and data visualization, devoted to proposing effective and explainable link prediction methods on biomedical interaction graphs.  -->
My primary research interest is **AI4Science**, concretely using **Language Models** and **Graph Machine Learning** techniques to help solve biomedical problems. Besides, I have been involved in some **Data Visualization** studies. I would appreciate any opportunity for relevant collaboration.
<!-- especially towards knowledge representation in real-world scenarios: identifying valuable problems, improving learning methods, and ensuring the insights gained are trustworthy. -->

<!-- ***I am looking for a Ph.D. position in 24 fall***, and here is a [blog](https://echochou990919.github.io/posts/blog-post-1/) introducing my strong self-motivation. It's usually said that "connection is all you need" for the Ph.D. application, and while I currently have few connections with the community of Graph. However, let's look at it positively from the perspective of "Link Prediction", what an exciting process of cold start! I would appreciate any opportunity for collaboration.   -->
