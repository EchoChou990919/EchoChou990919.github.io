Hello everyone! I am Yi Zhou, now a last-year master's student in the [Vision Computing Lab](https://scuvis.org/) at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Min Zhu](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1279/13673.htm). I received bachelor's degree from Sichuan University in 2021, under the [Wu Yuzhang honors program](https://www.scu.edu.cn/wyzxy/). Here is my [CV](https://echochou990919/files/YiZhou_CV.pdf).

My current background is in bioinformatics and data visualization, devoted to proposing effective and explainable link prediction methods on biomedical interaction graphs. My research interests are **Graph Machine Learning** and **Data Mining**, especially towards knowledge understanding in real-world scenarios: identifying valuable problems, improving learning methods, and ensuring the conducted insights are trustworthy.

<font color="#660000">I am looking for a Ph.D. position in 24 Fall preferably</font>, and here is a [blog]() introducing my strong self-motivation. It's widely said that "connection is all you need" for the Ph.D. application, and while I currently have few connections with the community of Graph. However, let's look at it positively from the perspective of "Link Prediction", what an exciting process of cold start! I would appreciate any opportunity for collaboration.
