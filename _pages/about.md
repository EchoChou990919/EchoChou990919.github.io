Hello everyone! I am Yi Zhou, now a last-year master's student in the [Colledge of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/) at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Min Zhu](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1279/13673.htm). And I received bachelor's degree from Sichuan University in 2021, under the [Wu Yuzhang Honors program](https://www.scu.edu.cn/wyzxy/).  
<!-- Here is my [CV](https://echochou990919.github.io/files/YiZhou_CV.pdf). -->

My current background is in bioinformatics and data visualization, devoted to proposing effective and explainable link prediction methods on biomedical interaction graphs. My research interests are **AI4Science** and **Graph Machine Learning**, especially towards knowledge representation in real-world scenarios: identifying valuable problems, improving learning methods, and ensuring the insights gained are trustworthy.

<!-- ***I am looking for a Ph.D. position in 24 fall*** preferably, and here is a [blog](https://echochou990919.github.io/posts/blog-post-1/) introducing my strong self-motivation. It's widely said that "connection is all you need" for the Ph.D. application, and while I currently have few connections with the community of Graph. However, let's look at it positively from the perspective of "Link Prediction", what an exciting process of cold start! I would appreciate any opportunity for collaboration.   -->
