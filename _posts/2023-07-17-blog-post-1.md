Motivation should be the most important thing for Ph.D. study, 

My motivation for research came late but went strong. Thanks to Prof. Min Zhu, all through the past three years in Vision Computing Lab, I've almostly experienced every part of academic research, . And I always keep a pure enthusiasum for research itself.  

"God, grant me the serenity to accept the thing I can not change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." Now I fully accept what has happened in the past, I'm proud of all my experience, although some of them were not that . And I've clearly recognized that it's time to change the environment of working, to receive more high-level instructions and collaborate with like-minded researchers.
